{"name":"Lifx-sharp","tagline":".NET C# API for the controlling LIFX bulbs","body":"LifxLib is a library containing classes representing Bulbs, PAN controllers, Communication and Messages sent from and to a physical LIFX bulb. The communication is done solely via UDP. \r\n\r\nSince the API is not available yet, I have relied on magicmonkeys terrific LIFX project (https://github.com/magicmonkey/lifxjs) which has a great documentation from observations made of network traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded is a test application showing how to use the lib to:\r\n* Discover PAN controllers/bulbs\r\n* Get/Set Power state\r\n* Get/Set Label\r\n* Get/Set Color parameters\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n==========\r\n\r\nDiscovery of bulb:\r\n```\r\n  LifxCommunicator.Instance.Initialize();\r\n\r\n  List<LifxPanController> panController = LifxCommunicator.Instance.Discover();\r\n  LifxBulb mBulb = panController[0].bulbs[0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet power state:\r\n```\r\n  LifxPowerState powerState = mBulb.GetPowerState();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet power state:\r\n```\r\n  mBulb.SetPowerState(LifxPowerState.On);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet Color:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  UInt16 kelvinValue = 1000;\r\n  UInt32 fadeTimeMilliseconds = 2000;\r\n  mBulb.SetColor(new LifxColor(Color.Red, kelvinValue), fadeTimeMilliseconds);\r\n```\r\nEtc...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
